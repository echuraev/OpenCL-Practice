Practice for presentation "Heterogeneous computing with OpenCL" from Intel Summer School 2017

OpenCLHeterogeneous makes conversions from colorful image to BW in case of computation only on one device (CPU or GPU) and set blue or red mask in case of heterogeneous computation. The color of mask depends on the device (CPU - blue, GPU - red).

Host code was written by using OpenCL C++ wrapper.
